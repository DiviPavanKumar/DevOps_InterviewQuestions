1. What is a Pod in Kubernetes?

 A Pod is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes. It represents a single instance of a running process in your cluster and can contain one or more containers.
yaml
CopyEdit
# pod.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
 name: nginx-pod
spec:
 containers:
 - name: nginx
 image: nginx
 ports:
 - containerPort: 80

2. What is a Deployment in Kubernetes? Write a deployment.yaml for deploying 3 replicas of an Nginx container.

 A Deployment is a controller that ensures the desired number of pod replicas are running. It allows rolling updates and rollbacks.
yaml
CopyEdit
# deployment.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
 name: nginx-deployment
spec:
 replicas: 3
 selector:
 matchLabels:
 app: nginx
 template:
 metadata:
 labels:
 app: nginx
 spec:
 containers:
 - name: nginx
 image: nginx
 ports:
 - containerPort: 80

3. What is a Service in Kubernetes, and what are the types?

 A Service exposes a set of pods as a network service.
 Types:
ClusterIP (default) – internal access within the cluster
NodePort – exposes service on each Node’s IP at a static port
LoadBalancer – exposes service via a cloud provider’s load balancer
ExternalName – maps service to an external DNS name

4. When would you use each type of Kubernetes Service (ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer, ExternalName)?

ClusterIP – internal communication (e.g., between microservices)
NodePort – expose service for testing/dev on a static port
LoadBalancer – expose to the internet in cloud environments
ExternalName – route to external services like database.example.com

5. Explain port, targetPort, and nodePort in a Service.

port: Port exposed by the Service (used inside the cluster)
targetPort: Port on the Pod the traffic is forwarded to
nodePort: (for NodePort type) External port on the node

6. How would you expose a Kubernetes app externally?

Use a LoadBalancer service (cloud)
Use NodePort (local/testing)
Use Ingress with an Ingress Controller

7. What is Helm, and what are its components (Chart, Repository, Release)?

Chart: A packaged Kubernetes application (YAML + templates)
Repository: Stores charts
Release: A deployed instance of a chart in a cluster

8. What is the difference between EXPOSE in a Dockerfile and docker run -p?

EXPOSE (Dockerfile): declares the container listens on a port (docs only)
-p (docker run): actually maps a container port to a host port

9. How do you run Nginx on a Linux server using Docker?
bash
CopyEdit
docker run -d -p 80:80 --name nginx nginx

Git:

What will happen if you do `git fetch`?

  `git fetch` updates your local repository with the latest changes from the remote repository, but it doesn't modify your working directory or merge those changes into your current branch. 
  It just pulls the new commits and data.

What's the difference between `git merge` and `git rebase`?
	* `git merge` combines changes from one branch into another, creating a new merge commit. It preserves the history of both branches.
	* `git rebase` moves or "replays" commits from one branch onto another, creating a linear history without merge commits. It rewrites the commit history.
	Merge: Preserves the commit history of both branches, creating a new merge commit. 
	Rebase: Rewrites commit history, proving a liner and clear history.

What's the difference between `git pull` and `git fetch`?
	* `git pull`: Downloads updates from the remote repository and automatically merges them into your current local branch.
	* `git fetch`: Downloads updates from the remote repository but doesn't merge them into your local branch.

Explain about GIT Branching in your project:
	In a Git project, branching allows multiple developers to work on different features or fixes simultaneously without interfering with each other’s work. Typically:
		1. Main branch (main or master): The stable production-ready branch.
		2. Feature branches: Used for developing new features (e.g., feature/login-page).
		3. Bugfix branches: For fixing bugs (e.g., bugfix/crash-on-login).
		4. Release branches: For preparing production releases (e.g., release/v1.0).
		5. Hotfix branches: For urgent fixes to production (e.g., hotfix/critical-fix).
	After work on a branch is complete, it's merged back into the main branch.

What is the git workflow?
	A common Git workflow involves the following steps:

		1. Clone the repository: git clone <repo-url>.
		2. Create a new branch for your work: git checkout -b <branch-name>.
		3. Make changes to the code and commit them: git add . and git commit -m "message".
		4. Push your branch to the remote repository: git push origin <branch-name>.
		5. Create a Pull Request (PR) to merge your changes into the main branch.
		6. Review and merge the PR after approval.

	This workflow keeps the main branch stable while allowing for parallel development.

What is git cherry pick?
	Git cherry-pick is a command that lets you apply a specific commit from one branch to another. You pick a commit by its ID, and Git copies its changes into your current branch.
	
	
Jenkins:

What is the difference between continuous Delivery and Deployment?

  Continuous Delivery ensures that code is always ready to be deployed to production, but deployment requires manual approval.
  Continuous Deployment automates the entire process, deploying every change to production automatically without manual intervention.
  
How to run a particular stage in jenkins pipeline?

  To run a particular stage in a Jenkins pipeline, you can use the "Build with Parameters" option and specify the stage using the `when` condition or manually trigger the 
  specific stage with `input` step or by using a script in the pipeline. Another approach is to comment out the other stages temporarily and run the desired one.

While running a job in jenkins, build got failed. How will you resolve that?
	To resolve a failed Jenkins build:

		1. Check Logs: Review the build console output for error details.
		2. Identify Cause: Look for issues like syntax errors, missing dependencies, or configuration problems.
		3. Fix Issue: Update code, pipeline script, or environment (e.g., install missing plugins or dependencies).
		4. Test Locally: Reproduce and verify the fix locally if possible.
		5. Retry Build: Trigger the job again in Jenkins.
		6. Monitor: Ensure the build completes successfully or repeat steps if it fails again.
	
		What type of error we may get?
		Common errors in a failed Jenkins build include:

		1. Syntax Errors: Incorrect code or script syntax in the pipeline or application.
		2. Dependency Issues: Missing libraries, packages, or plugins required for the build.
		3. Configuration Errors: Wrong environment variables, credentials, or Jenkins settings.
		4. Network Issues: Failure to connect to repositories, APIs, or external services.
		5. Permission Errors: Insufficient access to files, directories, or resources.
		6. Resource Limits: Insufficient memory, CPU, or disk space.
		7. Test Failures: Unit or integration tests failing due to code issues.
		8. Timeout Errors: Build taking too long, exceeding configured time limits.

Docker:

What is the Home Directory(path) of Docker?

  Linux: /var/lib/docker
  
How to integrate a docker server in Jenkins?

  To integrate a Docker server in Jenkins:
  1. Install Docker on the Jenkins server.
  2. Install the Docker plugin in Jenkins (Manage Jenkins > Manage Plugins > Docker Plugin).
  3. Configure Docker in Jenkins:
      * Go to Manage Jenkins > Configure System.
      * Under Cloud, add a Docker Cloud and provide Docker server details (e.g., Docker API URL, credentials).
  4. Use Docker in Jenkins Pipeline with commands like docker build, docker run, or docker-compose in your Jenkinsfile.
  This allows Jenkins to interact with Docker for building, testing, and deploying containers.

Write a dockerfile using a linux and a webserver?

  # Use an official Linux base image (Ubuntu in this case)
    FROM ubuntu:latest
  # Install Nginx web server
    RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y nginx
  # Copy website files to the Nginx default directory
    COPY ./html /var/www/html
  # Expose port 80 to access the web server
    EXPOSE 80
  # Start Nginx when the container runs
    CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
	
What's the difference between CMD and ENTRYPOINT in Docker?

	• CMD provides default commands or arguments that run when the container starts.
	  You can override it by passing a command when running the container.
	• ENTRYPOINT defines the main executable for the container. It always runs, and
	  cannot be overridden the same way.
	• If you try to pass a command when ENTRYPOINT is defined, it will append the
	  command to ENTRYPOINT instead of replacing it.
	• When used together, CMD can act as default arguments for the ENTRYPOINT
	  executable.
	• This combination gives you flexibility and control: ENTRYPOINT ensures a
	  specific binary runs, while CMD provides modifiable defaults. 

	Best practice: Combine both for consistent yet flexible container behavior.

What's the difference between COPY and ADD in Docker?
	• COPY is used to copy files and directories from the host to the image.
	• ADD does the same but also supports downloading files from URLs and
	  automatically extracting .tar archives.
	Use COPY by default, and use ADD only when you need its additional features.

What's the difference between ARG and ENV in Docker?
	• ARG:
		o Used in Dockerfile with ARG instruction.
		o Only available during build time (docker build).
		o Passed at build time using --build-arg (e.g., docker build --build-arg
		  VAR=value).
		o Not available in the running container unless set as ENV.
	• ENV:
		o Used in Dockerfile with ENV instruction.
		o Available during build time and runtime (inside the container).
		o Can be overridden at runtime using -e (e.g., docker run -e VAR=value).
	• Can ARG be passed at runtime?
		o No, ARG is only for build time. It cannot be passed during docker run.
		  Use ENV for runtime variables. 
	
Where you used docker to solve a specific problem?
	I used Docker to create consistent development environments for a team, ensuring all developers had the same dependencies and versions, eliminating "works on my machine" issues.
	
There are multiple stopped containers and unused network taking up spaces. How you will clean up these resources effectively?
	$ docker system prune -a
	Be cautious with prune commands as they permanently delete resources.
	
Kubernetes:

Architecture of Kubernetes?

	Kubernetes architecture consists of two main components:

	1. Control Plane:
		* API Server: Manages API requests and communicates with other components.
		* Scheduler: Assigns workloads (pods) to nodes.
		* Controller Manager: Ensures desired state of the system (e.g., scaling, replication).
		* etcd: Key-value store for cluster data.
	2. Node (Worker Node):
		* Kubelet: Ensures containers run in pods as expected.
		* Kube Proxy: Manages network routing and load balancing for services.
		* Container Runtime: Runs containers (e.g., Docker, containerd).

	The Control Plane manages the cluster, while Nodes run the workloads.

What's the difference between Kubernetes deployment and Statefulset?
	* Deployment: Used for stateless applications, where each pod is identical and can be replaced easily. It ensures desired replicas are running and updates pods in a rolling manner.

	* StatefulSet: Used for stateful applications, where each pod has a unique identity, persistent storage, and stable network identity. It ensures proper ordering and  stable storage for each pod.

What is namespace?
	namespaces are used for dividing cluster resources between multiple users. They are meant for environments where there are many users spread across projects or teams and provide a scope of resources.

What are the different services available within kubernetes?
	Kubernetes services include:

		1. ClusterIP: Default service, exposes a pod internally within the cluster.
		2. NodePort: Exposes the service on each node's IP at a static port.
		3. LoadBalancer: Exposes the service externally using a cloud provider's load balancer.
		4. ExternalName: Maps a service to an external DNS name without creating a proxy.
		5. Headless: Allows direct access to individual pods without a single IP, often used for stateful applications.
		
What is the types deployment stategy of kubernetes?
	Kubernetes deployment strategies include:

		1. Recreate: Terminates all old pods and creates new ones.
		2. Rolling Update: Gradually replaces old pods with new ones, ensuring minimal downtime.
		3. Blue/Green: Deploys new version alongside old, then switches traffic to new version.
		4. Canary: Deploys new version to a small subset of users before full rollout.
		5. A/B Testing: Tests new version with specific user groups based on conditions.

Ansible:

How to run a specific task on Ansible Playbook which contains 10 tasks?
	Tag the task in the playbook:

	- name: Example task
	  ansible.builtin.debug:
		msg: "Running specific task"
	  tags: mytask
	  
	Run the playbook with the --tags option:

	ansible-playbook playbook.yml --tags mytask

	Note: Only tasks with the specified tag (mytask) will run.
	
Terraform:

What is statefile?
    A statefile in Terraform is a JSON file (terraform.tfstate) that tracks the current state of your infrastructure. It records resource configurations, attributes, and dependencies, allowing Terraform to manage and update resources accurately.	
	statefile contains the history of deployment.
When state file will be created?
    The Terraform statefile (terraform.tfstate) is created when you run `terraform apply` or `terraform init` followed by `terraform plan` and `terraform apply` for the first time in a project directory.

#Docker Scenario-Based Interview Questions & Answers:

# Scenario_1
	You have a docker container running a web server, but you need to update the application code inside it.
	How would you approch this?
	
	Approach:
		1. Update the application code in the project directory.
		2. Rebuild the Docker image with the updated code: docker build -t image-name .
		3. Stop and remove the old container: docker stop container-name && docker rm container-name
		4. Run a new container with the updated image: docker run -d -p port:port image-name
		5. Alternatively, use a volume to mount updated code without rebuilding: docker run -v /local/code:/container/code ...

# Scenario_2
	Your team is deploying a microservices architecture using Docker containers.
	How would you orchestrate and manage these containers effectively?
	
	Approach:
		1. Use Kubernetes or Docker Compose for orchestration.
			* Docker Compose: Define services in docker-compose.yml for local development.
			* Kubernetes: Use deployments, services, and ingress for production.
		2. Manage networking with service discovery and load balancing.
		3. Monitor with tools like Prometheus and Grafana.
		4. Automate deployments with CI/CD pipelines (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI).

# Scenario_3
	You have encountered a problem where a Docker container keeps crashing without any clear error message.
	How would you troubleshoot and diagnose this issue?
	
	Approach:
		1. Check container logs: docker logs container-name
		2. Inspect container details: docker inspect container-name
		3. Run the container interactively: docker run -it image-name /bin/sh to debug.
		4. Verify resource limits (CPU, memory) and configuration (e.g., env variables).
		5. Review application errors or missing dependencies.
		6. Test with a minimal setup to isolate the issue.

# Scenario_4
	Your team needs to share data between multiple Docker containers.
	How would you accomplish this while maintaining isolation between the containers?
	
	Approach:
		1. Use Docker Volumes to share data: docker volume create shared-volume
		2. Mount the volume to multiple containers: docker run -v shared-volume:/data ...
		3. Alternatively, use a shared network for communication (e.g., via APIs).
		4. Ensure proper permissions and isolation with user namespaces and access controls.

# Scenario_5
	You need to ensure that your Docker containers are secure and compliant with company policies.
	What security best practices would you implement?
	
	Best Practices:
		1. Use minimal base images (e.g., alpine).
		2. Scan images for vulnerabilities: docker scan image-name
		3. Run containers as non-root users: USER nonroot in Dockerfile.
		4. Limit container privileges: Use --cap-drop and --read-only flags.
		5. Enable Docker Content Trust for image signing.
		6. Use secrets management for sensitive data (e.g., Docker secrets or Kubernetes secrets).
		7. Regularly update images and apply security patches.

1) What happens if your Kubernetes resource definition is accidentally deleted?
Answer: Kubernetes loses track of the resource. On next deployment, it attempts to recreate everything, causing duplicates or failures. Recovery may require manual intervention or restoring from backups. Always use GitOps for version control.
 2) How do you handle large-scale refactoring without downtime?
Answer: Use rolling updates and canary deployments to minimize impact. Split changes into smaller PRs and verify configurations carefully to prevent service disruption.
 3) What happens if a pod fails halfway through an update?
Answer: Kubernetes maintains the desired state. Failed pods are marked as unhealthy, and the system will attempt to restart them. Use readiness probes to ensure only healthy pods receive traffic.
 4) How do you manage secrets in Kubernetes?
Answer: Use Kubernetes Secrets or integrate with external secret management systems (like HashiCorp Vault). Ensure secrets are encrypted at rest and in transit, and follow best practices for RBAC.
 5) What happens if kubectl apply shows no changes but the cluster was modified outside Kubernetes?
Answer: Kubernetes remains unaware until a reconciliation occurs. Regularly implement drift detection to catch unauthorized changes.
 6) What happens if you delete a resource definition from your configuration?
Answer: Kubernetes destroys the corresponding resources. Use "kubectl delete" cautiously or apply resource protection annotations for critical components.
 7) What happens if a Kubernetes API version changes between releases?
Answer: Compatibility issues may arise. Always read release notes, use version constraints, and test upgrades in non-production environments to identify breaking changes.
 8) How do you implement zero-downtime updates in Kubernetes?
Answer: Leverage rolling updates, blue-green deployments, and health checks to ensure smooth transitions. For databases, consider using StatefulSets with proper failover strategies.
 9) What happens if you have circular dependencies in your Kubernetes manifests?
Answer: Kubernetes will encounter deployment issues. Refactor configurations to establish clear dependencies, possibly using Helm charts to manage complex relationships.
 10) What happens if you rename a resource in your Kubernetes configuration?
Answer: Kubernetes treats this as a deletion and recreation. Use annotations or update strategies to manage changes while preserving the resource state and minimizing downtime.
