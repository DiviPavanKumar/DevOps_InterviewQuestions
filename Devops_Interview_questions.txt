1. What is a Pod in Kubernetes?

 A Pod is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes. It represents a single instance of a running process in your cluster and can contain one or more containers.
yaml
CopyEdit
# pod.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
 name: nginx-pod
spec:
 containers:
 - name: nginx
 image: nginx
 ports:
 - containerPort: 80

2. What is a Deployment in Kubernetes? Write a deployment.yaml for deploying 3 replicas of an Nginx container.

 A Deployment is a controller that ensures the desired number of pod replicas are running. It allows rolling updates and rollbacks.
yaml
CopyEdit
# deployment.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
 name: nginx-deployment
spec:
 replicas: 3
 selector:
 matchLabels:
 app: nginx
 template:
 metadata:
 labels:
 app: nginx
 spec:
 containers:
 - name: nginx
 image: nginx
 ports:
 - containerPort: 80

3. What is a Service in Kubernetes, and what are the types?

 A Service exposes a set of pods as a network service.
 Types:
ClusterIP (default) – internal access within the cluster
NodePort – exposes service on each Node’s IP at a static port
LoadBalancer – exposes service via a cloud provider’s load balancer
ExternalName – maps service to an external DNS name

4. When would you use each type of Kubernetes Service (ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer, ExternalName)?

ClusterIP – internal communication (e.g., between microservices)
NodePort – expose service for testing/dev on a static port
LoadBalancer – expose to the internet in cloud environments
ExternalName – route to external services like database.example.com

5. Explain port, targetPort, and nodePort in a Service.

port: Port exposed by the Service (used inside the cluster)
targetPort: Port on the Pod the traffic is forwarded to
nodePort: (for NodePort type) External port on the node

6. How would you expose a Kubernetes app externally?

Use a LoadBalancer service (cloud)
Use NodePort (local/testing)
Use Ingress with an Ingress Controller

7. What is Helm, and what are its components (Chart, Repository, Release)?

Chart: A packaged Kubernetes application (YAML + templates)
Repository: Stores charts
Release: A deployed instance of a chart in a cluster

8. What is the difference between EXPOSE in a Dockerfile and docker run -p?

EXPOSE (Dockerfile): declares the container listens on a port (docs only)
-p (docker run): actually maps a container port to a host port

9. How do you run Nginx on a Linux server using Docker?
bash
CopyEdit
docker run -d -p 80:80 --name nginx nginx

By understanding these terms, you can effectively navigate the DevOps landscape and contribute to your team's success.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Git:

What will happen if you do `git fetch`?

  `git fetch` updates your local repository with the latest changes from the remote repository, but it doesn't modify your working directory or merge those changes into your current branch. 
  It just pulls the new commits and data.

Jenkins:

What is the difference between continuous Delivery and Deployment?

  Continuous Delivery ensures that code is always ready to be deployed to production, but deployment requires manual approval.
  Continuous Deployment automates the entire process, deploying every change to production automatically without manual intervention.
  
How to run a particular stage in jenkins pipeline?

  To run a particular stage in a Jenkins pipeline, you can use the "Build with Parameters" option and specify the stage using the `when` condition or manually trigger the 
  specific stage with `input` step or by using a script in the pipeline. Another approach is to comment out the other stages temporarily and run the desired one.

Docker:

What is the Home Directory(path) of Docker?

  Linux: /var/lib/docker
  
How to integrate a docker server in Jenkins?

  To integrate a Docker server in Jenkins:
  1. Install Docker on the Jenkins server.
  2. Install the Docker plugin in Jenkins (Manage Jenkins > Manage Plugins > Docker Plugin).
  3. Configure Docker in Jenkins:
      * Go to Manage Jenkins > Configure System.
      * Under Cloud, add a Docker Cloud and provide Docker server details (e.g., Docker API URL, credentials).
  4. Use Docker in Jenkins Pipeline with commands like docker build, docker run, or docker-compose in your Jenkinsfile.
  This allows Jenkins to interact with Docker for building, testing, and deploying containers.

Write a dockerfile using a linux and a webserver?

  # Use an official Linux base image (Ubuntu in this case)
    FROM ubuntu:latest
  # Install Nginx web server
    RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y nginx
  # Copy website files to the Nginx default directory
    COPY ./html /var/www/html
  # Expose port 80 to access the web server
    EXPOSE 80
  # Start Nginx when the container runs
    CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
	
What's the difference between CMD and ENTRYPOINT in Docker?

	• CMD provides default commands or arguments that run when the container starts.
	  You can override it by passing a command when running the container.
	• ENTRYPOINT defines the main executable for the container. It always runs, and
	  cannot be overridden the same way.
	• If you try to pass a command when ENTRYPOINT is defined, it will append the
	  command to ENTRYPOINT instead of replacing it.
	• When used together, CMD can act as default arguments for the ENTRYPOINT
	  executable.
	• This combination gives you flexibility and control: ENTRYPOINT ensures a
	  specific binary runs, while CMD provides modifiable defaults. 

	Best practice: Combine both for consistent yet flexible container behavior.

What's the difference between COPY and ADD in Docker?
	• COPY is used to copy files and directories from the host to the image.
	• ADD does the same but also supports downloading files from URLs and
	  automatically extracting .tar archives.
	Use COPY by default, and use ADD only when you need its additional features.

Kubernetes:

Architecture of Kubernetes?

	Kubernetes architecture consists of two main components:

	1. Control Plane:
		* API Server: Manages API requests and communicates with other components.
		* Scheduler: Assigns workloads (pods) to nodes.
		* Controller Manager: Ensures desired state of the system (e.g., scaling, replication).
		* etcd: Key-value store for cluster data.
	2. Node (Worker Node):
		* Kubelet: Ensures containers run in pods as expected.
		* Kube Proxy: Manages network routing and load balancing for services.
		* Container Runtime: Runs containers (e.g., Docker, containerd).

	The Control Plane manages the cluster, while Nodes run the workloads.
